        <h2>Ronnie Samuel</h2>
        <p>I am Ronnie Samuel II, a dedicated student currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My academic journey has fostered a deep passion for 
            technology, problem-solving, and software development. I have a strong interest in programming, particularly in areas like object-oriented programming,
            web development, and networking, which I actively explore through my coursework and personal projects. Beyond my studies, I serve as the treasurer for 
            the Panache Steel Orchestra, where I manage financial reports and contribute to the organization's events. My leadership roles have honed my organization
            al and teamwork skills, making me both a driven student and a committed team player. Outside of academics, I enjoy collaborating on creative projects, 
            whether itâ€™s in music or coding, and I am constantly seeking new challenges that allow me to grow personally and professionally.
